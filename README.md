Various implementation and help scripts for working with the Tibber GraphQL API

- `tibber.sh`: Dead simple curl client to test your access token and get access to your home ID.
  - Just change access token
- `tibber-mqtt-aio.py`: A Tibber websocket to MQTT streaming gateway using Async IO written in Python.
  - `pip3 install python_graphql_client aio-mqtt`


Interesting topics to delve into:
- Tibber API specifically
- GraphQL in general
- Websockets and streaming data (continoulsy and over time)
- Async IO and Python (specifically how to handle exceptions in async tasks)
- ...
